			<h1 class="title">The Story So Far</h1>

			<p>
				It all began when I succesfully plugged in and began to play Super Mario
				World on the Nintendo Super NES. After that, I was deeply interested in
				video games and how they worked. Eventually I discovered that they were
				written in something called code, which made me want to learn it so that
				I could make my own games.
			</p>
			<p>
				I quickly discovered that this was a <em><em>daunting</em></em> task and
				settled for creating a very simple calculator in High School. After
				realizing how much I did not know, I kind of gave up until I started
				college when they taught us Java day one. I enjoyed the class so much
				that I made a 100 in my first real programming class. The classes got
				much harder afterwards, however. It didn't matter to me, even if I made
				some lower grades because I was enjoying what I was doing.
			</p>
			<p>
				My first real project was not class related, but instead a project that
				I really wanted to accomplish. This project was developing an android
				application and publishing it to the
				<a
					href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.me.Bonker.android&hl=en_US"
					>Google Play Store</a
				>. It took a few months to complete, but I had done it. A few projects
				later (which you can see on my
				<a href="https://github.com/V1perW0lf?tab=repositories">GitHub</a>) I
				had graduated college and landed a great opportunity at a company called
				Talent Path. I am still in the program as I type this but it has been a
				great experience so far.
